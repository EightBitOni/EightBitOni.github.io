## Basic cracking

formatting
```bash
john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash1.txt
```
you can replace raw-md5 with intended hash and hash1.txt file with file that has other hash

if need to check the format hash 
```bash
john --list=formats
```

To use hash-identifier, you can just pull the python file from gitlab using:

`wget https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/hash-identifier/-/raw/kali/master/hash-id.py`

Then use the command

```bash
python3 hash-id.py [hash]
```


## John Unshadowing

```bash
unshadow local_passwd local_shadow > unshadowed.txt
```

- local_passwd file would be located in /etc/passwd

root:x:0:0::/root:/bin/bash

- local_shadow file would be located in /etc/shadow

root:$6$2nwjN454g.dv4HN/$m9Z/r2xVfweYVkrr.v5Ft8Ws3/YYksfNwq96UL1FX0OJjY1L6l.DS3KEVsZ9rOVLB/ldTeEL/OIhJZ4GMFMGA0:18576::::::

once unshadowed use basic cracking usually format is not needed

```bash 
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=sha512crypt unshadowed.txt
```


## Single Crack Mode

```bash
john --single --format=format [path to txt file]
```

If the username is known change formating on hash 
example:

**From:**  
1efee03cdcb96d90ad48ccc7b8666033

**To**
mike:1efee03cdcb96d90ad48ccc7b8666033


## Custom Rules

url for list of rule modifyers
https://www.openwall.com/john/doc/RULES.shtml

`[List.Rules:THMRules]` - Is used to define the name of your rule, this is what you will use to call your custom rule as a John argument.

We then use a regex style pattern match to define where in the word will be modified, again- we will only cover the basic and most common modifiers here:

`Az` - Takes the word and appends it with the characters you define  
`A0` - Takes the word and prepends it with the characters you define  
`c` - Capitalises the character positionally

These can be used in combination to define where and what in the word you want to modify.

Lastly, we then need to define what characters should be appended, prepended or otherwise included, we do this by adding character sets in square brackets `[ ]` in the order they should be used. These directly follow the modifier patterns inside of double quotes `" "`. Here are some common examples:

`[0-9]` - Will include numbers 0-9  
`[0]` - Will include only the number 0  
`[A-z]` - Will include both upper and lowercase  
`[A-Z]` - Will include only uppercase letters  
`[a-z]` - Will include only lowercase letters  
`[a]` - Will include only a  
`[!£$%@]` - Will include the symbols !£$%@

Putting this all together, in order to generate a wordlist from the rules that would match the example password "Polopassword1!" (assuming the word polopassword was in our wordlist) we would create a rule entry that looks like this:

`[List.Rules:PoloPassword]`

`cAz"[0-9] [!£$%@]"`

In order to:

Capitalise the first  letter - `c`
Append to the end of the word - `Az`
A number in the range 0-9 - `[0-9]`
Followed by a symbol that is one of `[!£$%@]`

#### Using Custom Rules

We could then call this custom rule as a John argument using the  `--rule=PoloPassword` flag.  

As a full command: `john --wordlist=[path to wordlist] --rule=PoloPassword [path to file]`

THM answers
What rule would we use to add all capital letters to the end of the word?
```
Az"[A-Z]"
```

What flag would we use to call a custom rule called "THMRules"  
--rule=THMRules
